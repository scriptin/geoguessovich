# [GeoGuessovich](https://scriptin.github.io/geoguessovich/) - Poor man's GeoGuessr

This game is an oversimplified parody of [GeoGuessr](https://www.geoguessr.com/), created with vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS.

Shown a city/town name, you and need to guess a country where that city/town is located in.
The game will tell you the correct answer.

### Project goals

1. Show that you don't necessarily need frameworks/libraries 
   (React, Vue, Angular, jQuery, etc.) to create 
   simple web applications for modern browsers.
2. Relieve the fatigue from writing bloated React apps.
3. Have fun. I don't plan to turn this into anything more than a silly little game.
